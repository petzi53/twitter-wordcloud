# twitter-wordcloud
Twitter wordcloud with English and German stopwords

See for details of how to use my description in my weblog article: [Twitter word clouds explained](http://peter.baumgartner.name/2017/04/09/twitter-word-clouds-explained/).

To see files with the file extension ".html" directly in GitHub you need to follow on of the two alternate procedures:

Go to the [HTML-Preview page](http://htmlpreview.github.io/) and either paste the URL or install the javascript bookmarklet. For repeated use I recommend the second alternative:

1. Drag the yellow marked link "HTMLPreview" to your browser bar
2. Call the GitHub html-page
3. Click on your bookmarket in your browser bar

If your prefer copy and paste: There is with [RawGit](http://rawgit.com/) a more convenient site to do.
